# Fashion_Mnist_Classification
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras in Python to classify the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model is trained and used to make predictions on two sample images from the test set.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Setup Instructions
1. Install TensorFlow and Keras:
        pip install tensorflow
   
## Running the Code
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the python script:  fashion_mnist_cnn.ipynb

## Understanding the Code:
The script does the following
- Load and preprocess the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- Build a CNN model with six layers.
- Compile and train the model.
- Make predictions on two images from the test set.

## Results
The script makes predictions for the first two images in the test set and displays them along with their actual labels.

### Result Interpretation
